        <p>
          Kathy was more than a friend or family member. She was a beacon of light and was a true advocate for what she believed in. She had a kindred✨ and beautiful🌹 personality that drew us close. She loved animals, especially cats 🐱🐈. During her studies at MIT, she would adorn her college room with all kinds of different plants🌱🪴🌵. When she was not studying or busy with creating the next masterpiece for the MIT video game orchestra🎼🎶🎷🎸🎹, she would pick up a game of chess or play the guitar. And of course, let's not forget her brilliance in mathematics is seldomly rivaled🧠💡📚. Her life was full of possiblities and wonder! This site is our way of keeping her memory alive and honoring the amazing person she was.
