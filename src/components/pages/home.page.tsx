        <p>
          Kathy was more than a friend or family member. She was a beacon of light‚ú® and was a true advocate for what she believed in. She had a kindred and beautifulüåπ personality that drew us close. She loved animals, especially cats. During her studies at MIT, she would adorn her college room with all kinds of different plants. When she was not studying or busy with creating the next masterpiece for the MIT video game orchestraüéπ, she would pick up a game of chess or play the guitar. And last but not least, her brilliance and passion for mathematics has allowed her to form bonds with great minded individuals. Her life was full of possiblities and wonder! This site is our way of keeping her memory alive and honoring the amazing person she was.
