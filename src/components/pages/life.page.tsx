      <p> For Kathy Yubin Xue </p>
      <p> July 30, 2003 - February 4, 2024 </p>
      <p>
        Kathy Yubin Xue, whose remarkable intellect and creative spirit
        illuminated the lives of all who knew her, passed away on February 4th,
        2024 at the tender age of 20, following a valiant fight against Diffuse
        Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Born on July 30, 2003, in Arlington,
        MA, to Zhengmin Xue and Wei Shi, Kathy's journey was a testament to her
        extraordinary talents in mathematics and music, and an unwavering
        determination that inspired everyone around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kathy's academic brilliance shone brightly during her year at MIT, where
        she pursued a major in mathematics, furthering her passion and
        showcasing her exceptional abilities. Her time at MIT was not only
        marked by academic achievements but also by her active involvement in
        the MIT Video Game Orchestra (VGO) club, where she combined her love for
        music and gaming, contributing to the club's performances and community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her mathematical journey was adorned with prestigious accolades,
        including two-times attendance to the USA Team Selection Test (TST) for
        the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in 2020 and 2021,
        attendance at the USA Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) in June 2019,
        winning the USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO) in April 2019, and
        achieving perfect scores in the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC
        10) in January 2018 and 2017. Kathy's talent for mathematics was
        paralleled by her achievements in music, serving as a member and captain
        of the Music Composition Club from 2017, being recognized as a finalist
        in the ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Awards in 2018, receiving
        Emerging Composer Nominations at the Tribeca New Music Young Composer
        Competition in 2018 and 2017, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond her achievements, Kathy's legacy is imbued with the love she
        shared, the lives she touched, and the dreams she nurtured not only for
        herself but also for her beloved younger sister, Audrey. Her aspirations
        to blend her mathematical genius with her musical talents were a source
        of inspiration to all, demonstrating her multifaceted talents and
        compassionate spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kathy is survived by her loving parents, Zhengmin Xue and Wei Shi, her
        brother Yu, her sister Audrey, and a vast community of friends, mentors,
        and admirers who were fortunate to have been part of her too-short
        journey. A funeral service to honor Kathy's life and legacy will be held
        at Mount Auburn Story Chapel on February 11th from 11:15 AM to 12:30 pm
        in memory of Kathy's courageous battle with DIPG and her indomitable
        spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kathy's year at MIT, her involvement in the VGO club, and her
        contributions to the fields of mathematics and music are enduring
        reminders of her brilliance and the profound impact she had on those
        around her. As we remember Kathy, we celebrate her life, cherishing the
        moments we shared and the incredible legacy she leaves behind.
